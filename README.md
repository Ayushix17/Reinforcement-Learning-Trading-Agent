# Reinforcement-Learning-Trading-Agent
This is about designing a self-learning agent tha interacts with the stock market data(or crypto/forex) and learns to buy/sell/hold based on reward signals. The tools and techniques used are - Custom Trading Environments and Financial APIs(like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance)

# 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent

A Python-based implementation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent for stock trading. The agent learns to make buy, hold, and sell decisions based on historical price data using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) or similar RL algorithm.

## 📌 Features

- Simulated stock trading environment
- State representation using windowed price history
- Action space: Buy, Hold, Sell
- Reward mechanism based on net profit/loss
- Model training and evaluation using deep Q-learning
- Portfolio value tracking and visualization

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch (check which one you used)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenAI Gym (if applicable)
- scikit-learn

## 📊 How It Works

1. Load historical stock price data.
2. Generate state windows based on previous n days.
3. Train a Deep Q-Network to choose actions maximizing cumulative reward.
4. Evaluate model performance on test data.
5. Visualize trading decisions and portfolio value.

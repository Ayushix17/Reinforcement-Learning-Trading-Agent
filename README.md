# Reinforcement-Learning-Trading-Agent
This is about designing a self-learning agent that interacts with the stock market data(or crypto/forex) and learns to buy/sell/hold based on reward signals. The tools and techniques used are - Custom Trading Environments and Financial APIs(like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance)

# üß† Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent

A Python-based implementation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent for stock trading. The agent learns to make buy, hold, and sell decisions based on historical price data using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) or similar RL algorithm.

## üìå Features
1. Financial Data Integration

Yahoo Finance API integration for real-time stock data
Alpha Vantage API support for professional-grade financial data
CoinGecko API for cryptocurrency data
Unified data provider interface for easy switching between sources

2. Custom Trading Environment

Gymnasium-compatible environment for RL training
Realistic trading mechanics with transaction costs and position limits
Technical indicators integration (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages)
Risk management with maximum position limits

3. Deep Q-Network (DQN) Agent

Experience replay for stable learning
Target network for improved convergence
Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
Neural network with dropout for regularization

4. Technical Analysis Tools

Simple Moving Average (SMA)
Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
Relative Strength Index (RSI)
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
Bollinger Bands

How It Works:

Data Collection: Fetches historical price data from financial APIs
Feature Engineering: Creates technical indicators and normalizes data
Environment Setup: Creates a trading simulation environment
Agent Training: Uses DQN to learn optimal buy/sell/hold strategies
Evaluation: Tests the trained agent on unseen data

Actions Available:

0: Hold position
1: Buy (increase long position)
2: Sell (reduce position/go short)

Reward System:

Based on portfolio performance vs market benchmark
Includes transaction cost penalties
Encourages profitable trading while minimizing excessive trades

Usage:
python# Basic usage
trainer = TradingAgentTrainer(symbol="AAPL")
agent, env = trainer.train_agent(episodes=100)

# For crypto trading
trainer = TradingAgentTrainer(symbol="bitcoin")  # For crypto via CoinGecko

# With Alpha Vantage API
data_provider = FinancialDataProvider(alpha_vantage_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
trainer = TradingAgentTrainer(symbol="AAPL", data_provider=data_provider)

## üìä How It Works

1. Load historical stock price data.
2. Generate state windows based on previous n days.
3. Train a Deep Q-Network to choose actions maximizing cumulative reward.
4. Evaluate model performance on test data.
5. Visualize trading decisions and portfolio value.
